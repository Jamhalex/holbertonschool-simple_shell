.TH SIMPLE_SHELL 1 "January 2026" "hsh" "User Commands"

.SH NAME
hsh \- simple UNIX command interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
.RI [command\ file]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a small command interpreter that reads lines from standard input, tokenizes
commands, resolves executables through the PATH, and executes them in child
processes. If a command cannot be resolved, no child process is created and an
error is reported. It mirrors a subset of the standard shell behavior for educational
purposes.
.SH MODES
.TP
.B Interactive
When stdin is a terminal, a prompt `($) ` is shown and each line is executed
immediately. Pressing Ctrl+C interrupts the current input line without
terminating the shell.
.TP
.B Non\-interactive
When input is piped or redirected from a file, commands are processed until
EOF without showing the prompt.
.SH BUILTINS
.TP
.B exit [status]
Exit the shell with the provided status. If no status is given, the exit value
of the last command is used.
.TP
.B env
Print the current environment variables, one per line.
.SH LIMITATIONS
.B hsh
implements a minimal subset of shell behavior for educational purposes.
It does not support quoting, escape sequences, pipes, redirections,
command chaining (such as `;`, `&&`, `||`), wildcard expansion, or job control.
In interactive mode, pressing Ctrl+C interrupts the current input line
without terminating the shell.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B PATH
Used to locate executables when a command is not given as an absolute or
relative path.
.SH FILES
.I shell.h
Header defining shared types and function prototypes.
