.SH NAME
hsh \- simple UNIX command interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hsh
.RI [command\ file]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hsh
is a small command interpreter that reads lines from standard input, tokenizes
commands, resolves executables through the PATH, and executes them in child
processes. If a command cannot be resolved, no child process is created and an
error is reported. It mirrors a subset of the standard shell behavior for educational
purposes.
.SH MODES
.TP
.B Interactive
When stdin is a terminal, a prompt `($) ` is shown and each line is executed
immediately.
.TP
.B Non\-interactive
When input is piped or redirected from a file, commands are processed until
EOF without showing the prompt.
.SH BUILTINS
